# iOS challenge

## What to expect
We want to learn more about how you approach a challenge as an iOS Engineer and for that we prepared a simple app that isn’t made with best practices in mind.

The challenge will be composed of a pair programming session, where we are going to improve and fix some issues in that app, that has a simple requirement:

```
As a potential traveler, I want to be able to fetch reviews for one of our most popular Berlin tours.
```

We’ll evaluate platform, architecture, testing, and problem solving-knowledge.

What you’ll need:
- Xcode and its command line tools installed
